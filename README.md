Contains Jupyter notebooks detailing important derivations and understanding in the area of crystal plasticity.

In this first update, the derivations required to successfully modify the Haung Crystal Plasticity UMAT (found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jk2079/Kysar_Research_Laboratory/Single_Crystal_UMAT.html) ) will be provided in the Jupyter document: 
*Understanding-Haung-UMAT*.  

If the details of this Jupyter notebook are helpful, please site this repository and the publication [Microstructure-informed, predictive crystal plasticity finite element model of fatigue-dwells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025620303141) which inspired this document.
